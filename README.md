## BSQ (Biggest Square)

### Description âœ¨
BSQ is a 42 project written in C.

We provide a configuration file representing a map to the program.
This map contains obstacles, the goal of the program is to find the biggest square in the map and replace it.
If several squares have the maximum size, then only the top left square of the map is replaced.

#### _Example of config file_
```
9.ox
...........................
....o......................
............o..............
...........................
....o......................
...............o...........
...........................
......o..............o.....
..o.......o................
```
- `9` represents the number of linse of the file, the width of each line must be the same on each line
- `.` is the character of the empty case that could be filled
- `o` represents the obstacles we must avoid
- `x` is the character of the future square replaced on the map

In this example the biggest square's output should be:
```
.....xxxxxxx...............
....oxxxxxxx...............
.....xxxxxxxo..............
.....xxxxxxx...............
....oxxxxxxx...............
.....xxxxxxx...o...........
.....xxxxxxx...............
......o..............o.....
..o.......o................
```
_It is indeed a square. Even if it doesn't look like one visually_

### Main purpose :page_facing_up:
The goal of this exercise is to parse the configuration file, then to implement the algorithm in C finding the largest square in any map, avoiding obstacles.
Once found, replace it by the characters and display it correctly.


### How to use :rocket:
First run ``make``, then:
```
./bsq map1
```
See the biggest square appear!
